# **Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis**

# Analysis Overview
    This project is intended to build a SQL Database using PgAdmin to assemble a group of CSV files containing employee data of "Pewlet Hackard". 

# *Purpose*
    The main purpose of this project is to create a data analysis to better understand the situation of employees soon to be retired, which company-wide is bein called "The Silver Wave". With such analysis we will be able to determine how many employees are soon to be retired, what positions will need to be replaced and whom of the retiring employees can still stay on board on a mentorship program for the future generation.
